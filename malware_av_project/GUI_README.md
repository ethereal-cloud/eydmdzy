# Web GUI

This project includes a Flask-based web interface for scanning and metrics.

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webapp.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## Notes

- Use the file picker to select folders or files; folder selection works best in Chrome/Edge.
- YARA rules are loaded from `rules/yara` and Sigma rules from `rules/sigma`.
- Metrics use the latest scan report and `samples/groundtruth.csv` (course evaluation only).
- Zircolite is used for Sigma scanning; set `ZIRCOLITE_PATH` or place it at `tools/zircolite/zircolite.py`.
- Sigma logs use `.evtx` format.
- Reports are saved as JSON and can be downloaded after each scan.
