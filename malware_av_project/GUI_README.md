# Web GUI

This project includes a Flask-based web interface for scanning and metrics.

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webapp.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## Notes

- Use the file picker to select folders or files; folder selection works best in Chrome/Edge.
- Sigma logs support `.evtx` and JSONL formats.
- Reports are saved as JSON and can be reused in the Metrics panel or downloaded.
